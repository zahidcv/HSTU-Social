# HSTU-Social

HSTU Social is a social media web application developed with the mindset of solving the problem of communication among HSTU students. Students of HSTU are virtually connected through some facebook groups. Which I found distracting and not intuitive enough. Necessary information like Blood Donation, Lost and Found or upcoming event posts were crumbled together within a single thread. In our application we have created separate section for each necessary post types. It's hard tonot find what you are looking for. 

Technologies Used: Python, Flask, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML,MySQL,
